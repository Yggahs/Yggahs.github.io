    description: `<b>Winner of Kingston Univeristy's 2018 Game Jam!</b> <br/> Cell Resistance is a top-down shooter taking place inside a sick person's body, where the player controls a white cell that can switch between two states of resistance. This game was developed as a team effort over the course of 24 hours during Kingston University's 2018 Game Jam. The contest's theme was "Resistance", thus we settled on the idea of a little white cell helping a body resist a viral attack. I was assigned the task of creating the AI for the enemies in the game.`,
