          My name is Alessio Calore and I'm a <span id="year"></span> year old
          post-graduate at Kingston University from Italy who dreams of becoming
          a game developer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">
          I've always been fascinated with videogames, so much so that I
          somewhat consider them a contemporary form of art; I do my best to
          have looks, narrative and gameplay blend in my work in such a way that
          it is at the very least pleasant to play.
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">
          I usually use either Unity or Unreal to work on my projects, and thus
          I know how to program in C# and C++, although I'm always open to
          learning new programming languages and tools.
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">
          For this reason, I've accepted non-gaming related jobs, and as a resul
          not only I learned some Java, but I also got into web development;<br />
          This site, for example, is made entirely by me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">
          When making games, I try and make most of the assets myself, and thus
          usually use Photoshop for what regards 2d and either Blender or Maya
          for 3d, although as of late I've had the opportunity to use Cinema4d
          as well.
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">
          Other than a bachelor's degree in games technology, my academic
          background includes a diploma in an IT oriented course, from which I
          learned the basics of programming; I got use out of this experience
          for a short time, all the way back in 2016 in Rome.
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">
          As soon as I came back from the UK, I started working for a software
          development company in Rome; a friend referred me in a web development
          company during this time and, looking to broaden my horizons in the IT
          field, I started working for this company soon after.
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">
          I'm currently employed as a web developer at SMID FACTORY in Rome, and
          work on game-dev related side projects in my spare time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">
          When working in groups I tend to take on the role of the leader, or at
          least monitor my teammates in such a way that not only makes for an
          interesting final result but also a good time overall. I find
          investment in a project very important to its overall success,
          therefore I always try to work on ideas that resonate with me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">
          Other hobbies include gaming, reading, watching movies and long walks
          on the beach.
